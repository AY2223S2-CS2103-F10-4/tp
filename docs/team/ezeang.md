### Project: NextBigFish (NBF)

NBF is a desktop app tailored for the needs of sales-people, supporting the management of contacts, leads or clients **
and optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, NBF can get your client and lead management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
NBF allows client contacts to hold data on their potential business size and counts of past transactions and aids users in categorising them using tags.
On top of that, NBF also provides a summary page to allow users to quickly get an overview of their performance each season, detailing relevant statistics.
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort by different fields as specified by user.
  * What it does: x.
  * Justification: x
  * Highlights: xThis enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added a filter command that allows the user to filter contacts by specifying tags.
